# Dynamic Programming (DP)

## Terminology
- "Memoization"
- "Tabulation"
- "Backtracking"

## DP vs DnC
Divide 'n' Conquer algorithms are algorithms that involve dividing a problem into smaller individual sub-problems, solving those sub-problems and combining the results. Dynamic Programming algorithms involve dividing the problem into individual distinct sub-problems, each distinct sub-problem is solved once each and the results are stored. This allows us to avoid re-solving problems we've already solved for. DP differs from DnC, by avoiding re-solving overlapping sub-problems.

DnC algorithms are generally suited for problems where sub-problems don't overlap. Dynamic programming is generally suited for problems where the sub-problems have overlap.
