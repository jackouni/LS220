# Traversal Techniques

## Node Orderings Acronym

This is a series of letters used to describe the order in which nodes are evaluated/operated on when traversing a binary tree. This order often uses `N` (representing the current node), `L` (representing the left node) and `R` (representing the right node).

## Depth-First Search (DFS)

This is a type of binary tree traversal that involves searching from the root node of a tree as far out/down it's subtrees before backtracking.

#### Pre-Order

This is a form of DFS that involves evaluating/operating on nodes in the order of NLR where the current node is evaluated first and then its' left node, and lastly its right node.

#### In-Order

This is a form of DFS that involves evaluating/operating on nodes in the order of LNR where the left node is evaluated first, then the current node, and lastly its right node.

#### Post-Order

This is a form of DFS that involves evaluating/operating on nodes in the order of LRN where the left and right nodes are evaluated/operated on first follwed by the current node last.
