# Divide and Conquer Algorithms

## Terminology
- Main Steps:
  - **Divide**
  - **Conquer**
  - **Combine**

- "Partitioning"
This is the process of dividing a set of data into 2 or more subsets. Generally, when talking about algorithms, partitioning is most often associated with rearraning elements of an Array. With algorithms like Quick Sort, partitioning is used in that elements that are less than a pivot are sorted to one side of that element, while elements that are greater than the pivot are sorted to the other side of the pivot in the data set.
